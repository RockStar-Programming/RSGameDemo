# RSGameDemo

The RSGameDemo repository is intended to support the blog
https://www.rockstarprogrammer.dk/

The repository will evolve over time, so make sure to check back once in a while.

Requirements for running the demo
---------------------------------
1) Windows 10+
2) Visual Studio 2022
3) DrawIO (optional)

The demo is a WinForms application using SkiaSharp.

It is intended as a "game demo" because I felt that would be most appealing,
plus it allows for showing a great varity of programming techniques.
