# RSGameDemo

The RSGameDemo repository is intended to support the blog
https://www.rockstarprogrammer.dk/

The repository will evolve over time, so make sure to check back once in a while.

Requirements for running the demo
---------------------------------
1) Windows 11
2) Visual Studio 2022
3) DrawIO (optional)

The demo is an UWP Windows application using Win2D.
I removed XAML to focus more on pure code.

It is intended as a "game demo" because I felt that would be most appealing,
plus it allows for showing a great varity of programming techniques.
